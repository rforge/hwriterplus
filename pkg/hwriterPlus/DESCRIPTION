Description: This package extends the package hwriter providing
	     facilities such as the inclusion of output from R, the
	     results of an R session, the display of mathematical
	     expressions using LaTeX notation and the incorporation of
	     SVG graphical objects.  It uses MathJax to display
	     mathematical expressions, in contrast to R2HTML which
	     uses ASCIIMathML.
