Add a meta argument to newPage so that author etc can be added as in
Siegrist (2007) recommendations

Change the headers to match what is in Siegrist (2007)

Fix the equation referencing. Record the equation number and a
label. Use the label to allow for reordering of the equations.
Use R code instead of JavaScript, then numbering should also work in Word.

Since only name works in Word, not id for creating links, allow
hwriteImage to have a name argument. Perhaps it doesn't need an id
argument?

Also can add other lists for numbering: tables, figures, headings.

Allow figures and tables to have captions??? Equations as well???

Convenience functions: to retrieve an equation number for example:
eqRef, takes a label and produces the corresponding equation number.

Use write.table to write objects of class table.

Use closures to establish counters for equations, sections etc.
